Developers are a unique audience. We're picky, skeptical, and we can spot BS from a mile away. Here's how to design for us.

## What Developers Want

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

Don't hide functionality behind clever animations. Show me what I need immediately.

Bad: Floating action button that reveals options on hover
Good: Clear navigation with labeled buttons

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

We live in our keyboards. Tab, Enter, Escape, Ctrl+K. If I can't navigate without a mouse, I'm out.

### 3. Fast Load Times

We know how long things *should* take. A 3-second load for a documentation site is unacceptable.

### 4. Dark Mode

This isn't optional. Many of us work in dim environments and stare at screens all day.

### 5. Readable Code Examples

If you're showing code:
- Use a good monospace font
- Add syntax highlighting
- Make it copyable
- Show the filename

## Design Patterns That Work

### The Terminal Aesthetic

Why does it resonate? Because it signals:
- "This is for technical users"
- Minimalism and focus
- No-nonsense functionality

### Monospace Typography

Using monospace for headings and UI elements creates a cohesive technical feel.

### Status Indicators

Green dot = good. Red dot = bad. Yellow dot = warning. Keep it simple.

### Command Palettes

Ctrl+K or Cmd+K to access everything. It's expected now.

## Patterns to Avoid

### Excessive Animations

A fade-in is fine. Page transitions that take 500ms are not.

### Marketing Speak

"Revolutionary." "Paradigm-shifting." "10x productivity."

Just tell us what it does.

### Hidden Documentation

If I have to watch a video to understand your API, I'm switching to a competitor.

### Mandatory Onboarding

Let me skip it. I'll figure it out.

## Color Considerations

For developer tools:

- High contrast is essential
- Avoid pure white backgrounds (#fff)
- Use semantic colors (red for errors, green for success)
- Test with colorblind users

## Typography

- **Body**: 16-18px minimum
- **Line height**: 1.5-1.8
- **Line length**: 60-80 characters
- **Code blocks**: Generous padding

## Conclusion

The best developer tools feel invisible. They don't get in the way. They anticipate what you need and deliver it instantly.

Design for efficiency. Respect our time. Keep it simple.
